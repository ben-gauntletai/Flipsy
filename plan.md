# Plan: AI-Driven TikTok-Style Application

This document details an end-to-end strategy for building a TikTok-style mobile application with AI capabilities. Our primary objective is to provide a clear, developer-friendly roadmap that reduces complexity while preserving robust functionality. Throughout, we'll use **Firebase** (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Hosting) for quick setup and seamless integration, **Flutter** for the frontend, and **Python + FastAPI** for advanced AI tasks.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend (Flutter)**
   - Write once, deploy to both iOS and Android.  
   - Integrate with Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Storage using the Dart/Flutter Firebase SDK.  
   - Keep business logic modular by using a well-organized folder structure:
     ```
     lib/
       features/
       services/
       widgets/
       models/
       utils/
     ```

2. **Backend**
   - **FastAPI** for specialized AI endpoints (transcription, video filters).  
   - **Firebase Cloud Functions** for real-time triggers (e.g., thumbnails, push notifications).

3. **Deployment & Configuration**
   - **Firebase Hosting**
   - Containerize FastAPI with Docker for smooth local development and easy scaling.  
   - Use **Firebase Emulators** for local testing to avoid accidental production writes.

4. **Security**
   - **Firebase Auth** enforces authentication across Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Functions.  
   - **Firestore Security Rules** ensure users can only access authorized data.  
   - Secure FastAPI endpoints with token checks (e.g., validate Firebase ID tokens or use a separate JWT approach).

5. **Ease of Development Tips**
   - Use environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) or a secure configuration management system (e.g., Firebase Config) to store API keys and sensitive information in local dev vs. production.  
   - Document common commands for launching local emulators, running Docker containers, and deploying Cloud Functions for quick onboarding of new developers.  
   - Maintain a `docs/` folder with "How Tos," architecture diagrams, and a troubleshooting guide.

## 2. User Authentication (Firebase Auth)

### 2.1. Objectives
- Enable users to sign up and log in quickly.  
- Keep sign-up flows for email/password, plus optional social logins (Google, Facebook).

### 2.2. Implementation

1. **On the Client (Flutter)**
   - Use the `firebase_auth` plugin for easy sign-in methods.  
   - Store the user state in a global provider or BLoC to render screens accordingly (logged in vs. not logged in).

2. **Firestore Integration**
   - Upon first registration, create a `users/{userId}` document with fields:
     - `displayName`, `avatarURL`, `email`, `userType`, `createdAt` (timestamp).  
   - Optional: Enforce a unique username or handle to reduce confusion.

3. **Security & Validation**
   - Frontend validation: ensure passwords and emails are well-formed.  
   - **Firestore Rules**: only the current user can update their own user document.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Emulate Firebase Auth locally to test sign-up, login, and security rules with no production risk.  
- Provide a helper function for quickly retrieving/updating user profile data after authentication events.

## 3. Video Upload & Management

### 3.1. Objectives
- Offer a smooth experience for recording or selecting videos.  
- Manage uploads and references between Firestore and Cloud Storage.

### 3.2. Implementation 

1. **Upload Flow**
   - In Flutter, use `image_picker` or a custom camera plugin (e.g., `camera`).  
   - Show a progress bar using `firebase_storage`'s upload task stream.  
   - Store videos in a structured path: `videos/{userId}/{videoId}`, making it intuitive to find.

2. **Firestore Document**
   - After upload, create a `videos/{videoId}` doc containing:
     - `videoURL`, `thumbnailURL`, `uploaderId`, `description` (optional), `timestamp`, `likesCount`, `commentsCount`.  
   - Optionally include `duration` or `width/height` to optimize UI (like aspect ratio for thumbnails).

3. **Thumbnail Handling**
   - Generate thumbnails on the client (via FFmpeg plugin) or a Cloud Function to save device resources.  
   - Store them under `thumbnails/{userId}/{videoId}.png` for easy retrieval.

4. **Security**
   - **Storage Security Rules**: Ensure only authenticated users can upload.  
   - Each user can only delete or modify their own video.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Consider building a helper class (e.g., `VideoService`) that centralizes the logic for uploading and generating related Firestore docs. This prevents scattershot code across multiple files.

## 4. Feed and Discovery (Random)

### 4.1. Objectives
- Mimic TikTok's infinite vertical feed but with random content selection.  
- Focus on discoverability rather than sophisticated recommendation algorithms.

### 4.2. Implementation

1. **Randomization Approach**
   - Keep a `videos` collection, then:
     - Fetch a list of video IDs, shuffle them, and load in chunks.  
     - Alternatively, store a pseudo-random field in each doc and query subsets.

2. **Pagination & Performance**
   - Use Firestore's pagination mechanisms (e.g., `limit()` and `startAfterDocument()`).  
   - Pre-fetch or lazy-load to keep memory usage low.

3. **Video Playback UI**
   - Flutter's `video_player` package for full-screen or near-full-screen autoplay.  
   - Implement "snap" scrolling with a `PageView` or specialized scrolling widget for a TikTok-like experience.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- In early prototypes, you can simply query all videos and randomly pick a subset. Optimize later as content scales.  
- Maintain a small local cache (e.g., using `Hive` or the default Firestore offline cache) for a smoother offline/low-connectivity experience.

## 5. Engagement: Likes, Comments, Profiles

### 5.1. Objectives
- Allow users to engage with content immediately (like, comment, share).  
- Provide a clean profile screen where users see their own content.

### 5.2. Implementation

1. **Profiles**
   - Show essential user info (avatar, display name, total videos, total likes).  
   - Fetch the user's videos by `uploaderId`.

2. **Likes & Comments**
   - For each video doc (`videos/{videoId}`):
     - `likesCount` (int) can be incremented atomically (e.g., `FieldValue.increment(1)` in Firestore).  
     - `commentsCount` (int) updated similarly.  
   - If you need to know exactly which users liked a video, use a subcollection or an array of userIds.

3. **Real-Time**
   - Firestore listeners automatically update likes/comments in the feed.  
   - flutter's real-time streams simplify the UI.  
   - For push notifications, use Cloud Functions to watch new writes.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Avoid large arrays to store likes if you expect many likes. A subcollection (`likes`) is more scalable.  
- Provide a `ProfileService` or a dedicated BLoC that fetches the user's profile data in a single place.

## 6. AI & Generative Features

### 6.1. Objectives
- Provide AI-driven enhancements without overcomplicating the initial build.  
- Keep these features optional so the base app remains functional even if AI scripts fail.

### 6.2. FastAPI Integration

1. **Endpoints**
   - `POST /ai/transcribe`: ensures quick speech-to-text for captions.  
   - `POST /ai/transform`: allows style transfer or filters.

2. **Flow**
   - Video is uploaded to Cloud Storage.  
   - A Cloud Function or the client calls FastAPI with the file URL.  
   - FastAPI processes the request (e.g., transcribe audio, apply filters) and uploads the result back to Storage.  
   - Firestore is updated with any new references (e.g., `captionsURL`, `enhancedVideoURL`).

3. **Security**
   - Validate requests using Firebase Admin SDK or a JWT approach so only authorized users trigger AI tasks.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Containerize FastAPI with Docker so you can run complex dependencies (like PyTorch, FFmpeg) locally without messing up your primary environment.  
- Provide a simple Python CLI or scripts for debugging AI tasks outside of the Cloud to replicate real scenarios.

## 7. Cloud Functions Triggers & Notifications

### 7.1. Objectives
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., thumbnail creation, content moderation).  
- Send push notifications for critical events (likes, comments).

### 7.2. Implementation

1. **Thumbnail Generation**  
   - Cloud Function triggers on Storage upload to `videos/`.  
   - Generate or confirm the thumbnail is ready, store to `thumbnails/`, and update Firestore.

2. **Notifications**  
   - Watch writes to `comments` or `likes` subcollection.  
   - Use Firebase Admin SDK to send FCM push messages to the video owner or the relevant user.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Remember to use environment variables or Firebase config to store external API keys used in Cloud Functions.  
- Use the Firebase Emulator for local testing of triggers to avoid unnecessary deployment cycles.

---

## 8. Developer Workflow & Tooling

1. **Local Environment**
   - Use `.env` or environment variables for Firebase project IDs or AI API keys.  
   - Dockerize both Flutter testing environment (optional) and FastAPI to keep dependencies pinned.

2. **CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions (or GitLab, Bitrise) to automate building and testing the Flutter app.  
   - Auto-deploy to Firebase App Distribution for QA testers.  
   - Tag stable releases for production.

3. **Code Quality & Linting**
   - Enable Flutter's built-in linter or use `flutter_lints` to maintain consistent code style.  
   - For Python + FastAPI, use `flake8` or `black` for formatting and quality control.

4. **Monitoring & Logs**
   - Use Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics for real-time crash reports and usage stats.  
   - For FastAPI, log incoming requests and AI processing times for performance insights.

**Dev-Friendly Tip:**  
- Maintain good commit hygiene (small, descriptive commits) and thorough PR reviews to avoid confusion.  
- Keep a well-documented `README.md` in each service (Flutter, FastAPI, Cloud Functions) explaining local setup steps.

## 9. Step-by-Step Development Flow

To avoid overwhelm, we'll build each piece end-to-end before moving to the next:

1. **User Auth & Minimal Profile**
   - Implement Auth flows, store user data in Firestore, set up login and registration screens.

2. **Video Upload & Basic Playback**
   - Connect Storage with Firestore references.  
   - Build a simple "Home" feed for verifying playback.

3. **Likes, Comments & Notifications**
   - Implement real-time updates in the feed for engagement.  
   - Configure Cloud Functions for push notifications on new comments/likes.

4. **Randomized Feed & Profile**
   - Add random distribution logic.  
   - Build user profile screen: listing user's videos, total engagements, etc.

5. **Initial AI Integration**
   - Spin up FastAPI with Docker.  
   - Create one AI feature (e.g., auto-captioning) to confirm end-to-end connectivity.

6. **Advanced AI (Optional)**
   - Style transfer, highlight reel generation, or content moderation.  
   - Expand your FastAPI service to handle more complex tasks.

7. **Polish & Deploy**
   - QA test on Android and iOS.  
   - Finalize security rules, config environment variables.  
   - Deploy to production (Play Store, App Store).

## 10. Additional AI Brainstorming

- **AI-Driven Hashtags:** Suggest relevant hashtags for SEO-like discovery.  
- **Voice Reaction Overlays:** Analyze user audio to generate emotive overlays (fun, but mind privacy).  
- **Smart Summaries / Trailers:** Predict the most interesting 5–10 seconds for quick previews.  
- **Ethical Monitoring:** Automatic detection of violence or explicit content.  

---

## 11. Final Considerations

- **Cost Management:**  
  - Keep an eye on how often AI tasks run or how large the video files are (storage and egress can ramp up costs quickly).  
- **Scalability:**  
  - Plan a "sharding" strategy or use Firestore's built-in indexing if your "videos" collection grows large.  
- **User Experience (UX):**  
  - Provide clever placeholders or skeleton loaders for slower networks.  
  - Offer offline-friendly patterns for partial usage in poor connectivity environments.  
- **Documentation:**  
  - Each feature or microservice has a small `README.md` or doc page.  
  - Keep a "release notes" or changelog to inform developers of major changes or schema updates.
